Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make   party start
We used to mix hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks   you can hardly talk
And by   sixth gin you gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you gon' probably fall
Either somewhere     lobby     hallway wall
And everything's spinnin'
You're beginning to think women   swimmin   pink linen
Again     sink
Then     couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You   now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have   right to remain violent and start wildin'
Start   fight with   same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get     car and start it and start drivin'
Over   island and 'cause   42 car pile up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life   this planet sir, no sign of it
All i could see is   bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me   of this place I'm outta place
I'm     outter space, I've just vanished without   trace
I'm going to   pretty place now where   flowers grow
I'll be back   an hour   so
